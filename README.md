STEP 1 : FIRST I ADD THE DATASET TO POWERBI AND DO SOME BASIC DATA CLEANING WORKS
STEP 2: DONE SOME VISUALISATIONS IN IT
  VISUAL 1- ONE CARD SHOWING THE TOTAL SALES
  VISUAL 2- A CARD THAT SHOWS THE GROSS SALES
  VISUAL 3- A CARD THAT SHOWS THE TOTAL SLAES
  VISUAL 4 - A SLICER THAT SHOWS THE YEAR 2013 AND 2014
  VISUAL 5-  A MAP GIVEN THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORLDWIDE SALES
  VISUAL 6- A BARCHART THAT SHOWS THE SALES OVER DIFFERENT COUNTRIES - UNITED NATIONS HAS THE MOST NUMBER OF SALES
  VISUAL 7- A DONUT CHART GIVING THE INFORMATION ABOUT SALES OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS - FROM THIS WE CAN SEE THAT THE PRODUCT PASEO HAVE HIGHEST SALES AMONG THE PRODUCTS AND CARRETERA HAVE THE LEAST
  VISUAL 8- A LINE CHART SHOWING THE SALES OVER YEARS 
  VISUAL 9 - A TABLE THAT CONTAIN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SALES, TOTAL UNIT SOLD,TOTAL SALE PRICE AND TOTAL PROFIT

THEN I ADD BUTTONS ON EACH PAGE FOR GOTO NEXT PAGE AND PREVIOUS PAGE

                                                      IF SELECT THE DATE BUTTON , WE GET A LINE CHART SHOWING THE SALES OF 2013 AND 2014 MONTHWISE
                                                      IF THE BUTTON 2 IS SELECTED , WE GET A DONUT CHART CONTAINING THE SALES BY SEGMENT

THATS ALL , THANK YOU
